Java Calculator – Swing

This project is a simple calculator application developed in Java using the Swing library. It was created as a beginner project to practice Java fundamentals, object-oriented programming, and basic graphical user interface concepts.

The application allows the user to enter a number and perform several mathematical operations, including calculating the remainder when divided by two, raising the number to the power of three, calculating the cube root, the square root, and the absolute value. The results are displayed on the screen after the calculation.

The project uses a separate service class to handle the calculation logic, keeping the code more organized and easier to understand. The graphical interface and user interactions are managed in the main window class.

This project was developed using NetBeans and is intended for learning purposes only.
