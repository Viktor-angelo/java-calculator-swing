Java Calculator – Swing

This project is a simple calculator application developed in Java using the Swing library. It was created as a beginner-level project with the goal of practicing Java fundamentals, object-oriented programming, and basic graphical user interface concepts.

The application allows the user to enter a number and perform several mathematical operations, such as calculating the remainder when divided by two, raising the number to the power of three, calculating the cube root, the square root, and the absolute value. All calculations are handled by a separate service class, keeping the code organized and easier to understand.

This project was built using NetBeans and is intended for learning purposes. It does not aim to be complex or fully optimized, but rather clear and educational for anyone starting with Java and desktop applications.
